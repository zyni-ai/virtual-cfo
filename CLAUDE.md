## MCP Tools (Laravel Boost)

- `search-docs` - Search Laravel/Pest docs for version-specific patterns (Laravel 12, Pest 4)
- `database-schema` - Review existing tables before creating migrations
- `database-query` - Run queries to verify data/relationships
- `tinker` - Test code snippets and verify implementations
- `list-routes` - Check existing routes

Use `search-docs` before implementing non-trivial Laravel features.

## Workflow

**Cycle:** Explore → Plan → Code → Commit

1. **Explore** - Read relevant files, understand context. Don't write code yet.
2. **Plan** - Use Plan Mode for non-trivial work. Create issue via `gh issue create`.
3. **Code** - TDD: Write failing tests → Implement → Refactor. Be explicit about TDD to avoid mock implementations.
4. **Verify** - Tests are the verification. Run `php artisan test --filter=<related>` and ensure all pass before committing.
5. **Commit** - At natural breakpoints: after tests written, after tests pass, after PR ready.

**Branch:** `<type>/<issue#>-<description>` (e.g., `feat/42-import-parser`)
**Commit:** `<type>(scope): description (#issue)`
**Types:** `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `test`, `docs`, `chore`
**PR:** `gh pr create` — must include "Closes #XX"

**TDD (IMPORTANT):** RED → GREEN → REFACTOR. Don't skip the refactor step — clean up code, remove duplication, improve naming after tests pass.

**Context:** Use `/clear` between unrelated tasks to avoid context pollution.

## Branching Strategy (Trunk-Based)

```
feature/* → master (squash merge) → CD → staging/QA → tag vX.Y.Z → production
```

| Branch | Purpose | PR Target | Protection |
|--------|---------|-----------|------------|
| `master` | Trunk — staging/QA deploys from here | - | All CI + 1 review + admins |
| `feature/*`, `fix/*` | New work | `master` | None |
| `hotfix/*` | Urgent prod fixes | `master` | None |

**Merge strategy:** Always squash merge into `master`.
**CI checks required before merge:** Syntax, Pint, PHPStan, Security, Tests

## Common Mistakes (AVOID)

These patterns have caused issues — don't repeat them:

- **Don't skip REFACTOR in TDD** - After tests pass, clean up code, remove duplication, improve naming
- **Don't use inline validation** - Always use Form Request classes, never `$request->validate()`
- **Don't create mock implementations** - During TDD, write real code that passes tests
- **Don't use complex bash commands** - Pipes/loops stall on Windows; use built-in tools instead
- **Don't assume FK indexes exist** - PostgreSQL doesn't auto-create them; add explicitly
- **Don't forget to read docs first** - Check `docs/` before implementing

## Project Overview

Virtual CFO application for automating bank/credit card statement processing, account head mapping, and Tally XML export. Built for the accounts team at Zysk Technologies.

## Tech Stack

- PHP 8.4 + Laravel 12
- Filament v5 (admin panel)
- PostgreSQL (single database, JSONB for flexible schemas)
- Laravel AI SDK (`laravel/ai`) with Mistral as primary LLM provider
- Laravel Boost + Filament Blueprint
- Pest 4 (testing) + Larastan (static analysis)
- Database queue driver (`php artisan queue:work`)
- Maatwebsite Excel (CSV/Excel import/export)
- Spatie Activity Log (audit trail)
- Barryvdh DomPDF (PDF report generation)

## Architecture Decisions

### Database: PostgreSQL (not MongoDB)
Originally considered MongoDB for schema flexibility (different banks have different column names). Chose PostgreSQL with JSONB columns instead because:
- Filament does not officially support MongoDB — causes "database engine does not support inserting while ignoring errors"
- JSONB provides identical schema flexibility with `raw_data` column
- Single database eliminates hybrid complexity
- Full ACID transactions, GIN indexes on JSONB, relational integrity

### LLM: Laravel AI SDK (not Prism PHP)
Chose `laravel/ai` over `prism-php/prism` because:
- First-party Laravel package — guaranteed long-term support
- Native agent framework (`php artisan make:agent`)
- Built-in file attachments, queue support, structured output
- Built-in testing with `Agent::fake()` and assertions
- Prism PHP is community-maintained with less integrated features

### PDF Parsing: LLM-powered (not regex/pdfparser)
Using Mistral LLM to parse bank statements instead of smalot/pdfparser because:
- Bank statements have wildly different layouts per bank
- Regex-based parsing requires per-bank parser maintenance
- LLM handles any format — detects columns, extracts structured data
- Works for both text-based and scanned PDFs
- Cost: ~$2/1000 pages via Mistral

### Head Matching: Hybrid (rules + LLM)
Two-pass approach:
1. Rule-based matching (fast, cheap, deterministic) for known patterns
2. LLM-based matching for ambiguous transactions with confidence scores
3. Manual review for anything below confidence threshold

### Encryption
All sensitive financial data encrypted at rest using Laravel's built-in encryption (AES-256-CBC via APP_KEY). Encrypted fields: account_number, description, debit, credit, balance, raw_data.

### Queue: Database driver (not Redis + Horizon)
Removed `laravel/horizon` and Redis dependency. Using PostgreSQL-backed database queue instead because:
- Very few users (small accounts team) — Redis throughput is unnecessary
- One less infrastructure dependency to install, configure, and monitor
- The bottleneck is external AI API calls (5-30s), not queue dispatch speed
- Database queues provide ACID guarantees on job storage
- Jobs are inspectable via SQL — easier debugging
- `php artisan queue:work` is sufficient; Horizon's dashboard adds no value at this scale

### File Storage
PDFs stored in `storage/app/private/statements/` — never publicly accessible. Served only through authenticated Filament routes.

## Environment

- PostgreSQL required (not MySQL/SQLite)
- Pint auto-runs via hook after PHP edits — no need to run manually
- Tests use Pest with `describe`/`it` blocks — follow existing test patterns

## Model Safety Mechanisms

Laravel's safety mechanisms are enabled in non-production environments:

| Mechanism | Purpose | Fix |
|-----------|---------|-----|
| `preventLazyLoading` | Catches N+1 queries | Use `with()` for eager loading |
| `preventAccessingMissingAttributes` | Catches typos in attributes | Add missing accessors |
| `preventSilentlyDiscardingAttributes` | Catches mass assignment issues | Add to `$fillable` |

**Windows CLI (IMPORTANT):** Complex bash commands (pipes, loops) may stall. Use built-in tools instead:
- `Grep` tool instead of `grep` or `rg` commands
- `Glob` tool instead of `find` commands
- `Read` tool instead of `cat`, `head`, `tail` commands

## PostgreSQL Rules (IMPORTANT)

For new migrations, these rules are non-negotiable:

| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| `TEXT` | `VARCHAR(n)` |
| `TIMESTAMPTZ` | `TIMESTAMP` |
| `BIGINT GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY` | `SERIAL` |
| `JSONB` with CHECK constraint | `JSON` |
| Explicit FK indexes | Assume auto-indexing |
| Partial unique: `WHERE deleted_at IS NULL` | Table-level unique with soft deletes |

## Key Patterns

### Enums
- `ImportStatus`: pending, processing, completed, failed
- `MappingType`: unmapped, auto, manual, ai
- `MatchType`: contains, exact, regex
- `StatementType`: bank, credit_card, invoice (planned)

### AI Agents
- `StatementParser` — PDF bank/CC statements → structured transaction data
- `InvoiceParser` — PDF invoices → vendor details, GST breakup, line items (planned, see #42)
- `HeadMatcher` — transaction descriptions → account head suggestions with confidence

See [AI Agent Design](docs/architecture/ai-agent-design.md) for architecture rationale.

**Model configuration:** Each agent reads its model from `config/ai.php` via environment variables:

| Agent | Env Var | Config Key | Default |
|-------|---------|------------|---------|
| `StatementParser` | `AI_PARSING_MODEL` | `ai.models.parsing` | `mistral-large-latest` |
| `HeadMatcher` | `AI_MATCHING_MODEL` | `ai.models.matching` | `mistral-large-latest` |

The agents use the `model()` method (laravel/ai convention) to resolve the model at runtime, allowing model changes without code modifications.

### Background Jobs
- `ProcessImportedFile` — parses PDF via StatementParser agent, creates transactions
- `MatchTransactionHeads` — runs rule-based + AI matching on unmapped transactions

## Documentation

| Folder | Purpose | When to Read |
|--------|---------|--------------|
| `docs/architecture/` | Architecture decisions (pipeline, agents, data model, Tally XML) | Before implementing #40–#43, #15 |
| `docs/guides/` | How-to guides (AI workflow, testing) | For step-by-step workflows |
| `docs/PLAN.md` | Project setup plan and implementation order | For project context |

### AI-Assisted Development Workflow

Follow the [AI-Assisted Development Workflow](docs/guides/ai-assisted-development-workflow.md) for all implementation tasks. It defines the 7-step process (Understand → Implement → CI Checks → Review & Test → Commit → Comment → Next Task) including TDD workflows, MCP tool usage, and quality gates.

### Testing Best Practices

Follow the [Testing Best Practices](docs/guides/testing-best-practices.md) guide when writing or reviewing tests. Key rules:

- **Testing Diamond:** ~5% static, ~25% unit/arch, ~65% integration, ~5% E2E
- **No config-value assertions** — test behavior, not `config('key') === 'value'`
- **No Reflection-based tests** — test public API, not internal implementation
- **No assertOk-only tests** — every test must assert something beyond HTTP 200
- **Filament CRUD tests** must verify form fields, table records, or visible content

## Pipeline Architecture

```
Upload → Parse → Reconcile → Export
```

The full pipeline is documented in `docs/architecture/`:
- [Reconciliation Pipeline](docs/architecture/reconciliation-pipeline.md) — overview and dependency graph
- [AI Agent Design](docs/architecture/ai-agent-design.md) — why focused agents behind one service
- [Data Model: JSONB Strategy](docs/architecture/data-model-jsonb.md) — raw_data flow through stages
- [Tally XML Format](docs/architecture/tally-xml-format.md) — field reference and examples from real Tally export

## Development Notes
- Very few users (small accounts team)
- Tally XML reference file: `DayBook zysk april25.xml` (April 2025, UTF-16LE, 383 vouchers)
- OCR support via Mistral handles scanned PDFs automatically

=== foundation rules ===

# Laravel Boost Guidelines

The Laravel Boost guidelines are specifically curated by Laravel maintainers for this application. These guidelines should be followed closely to enhance the user's satisfaction building Laravel applications.

## Foundational Context
This application is a Laravel application and its main Laravel ecosystems package & versions are below. You are an expert with them all. Ensure you abide by these specific packages & versions.

- php - 8.4.16
- filament/filament (FILAMENT) - v5
- laravel/framework (LARAVEL) - v12
- laravel/horizon (HORIZON) - v5
- laravel/prompts (PROMPTS) - v0
- livewire/livewire (LIVEWIRE) - v4
- larastan/larastan (LARASTAN) - v3
- laravel/mcp (MCP) - v0
- laravel/pint (PINT) - v1
- laravel/sail (SAIL) - v1
- pestphp/pest (PEST) - v4
- phpunit/phpunit (PHPUNIT) - v12

## Conventions
- You must follow all existing code conventions used in this application. When creating or editing a file, check sibling files for the correct structure, approach, and naming.
- Use descriptive names for variables and methods. For example, `isRegisteredForDiscounts`, not `discount()`.
- Check for existing components to reuse before writing a new one.

## Verification Scripts
- Do not create verification scripts or tinker when tests cover that functionality and prove it works. Unit and feature tests are more important.

## Application Structure & Architecture
- Stick to existing directory structure; don't create new base folders without approval.
- Do not change the application's dependencies without approval.

## Frontend Bundling
- If the user doesn't see a frontend change reflected in the UI, it could mean they need to run `npm run build`, `npm run dev`, or `composer run dev`. Ask them.

## Replies
- Be concise in your explanations - focus on what's important rather than explaining obvious details.

## Documentation Files
- You must only create documentation files if explicitly requested by the user.

=== boost rules ===

## Laravel Boost
- Laravel Boost is an MCP server that comes with powerful tools designed specifically for this application. Use them.

## Artisan
- Use the `list-artisan-commands` tool when you need to call an Artisan command to double-check the available parameters.

## URLs
- Whenever you share a project URL with the user, you should use the `get-absolute-url` tool to ensure you're using the correct scheme, domain/IP, and port.

## Tinker / Debugging
- You should use the `tinker` tool when you need to execute PHP to debug code or query Eloquent models directly.
- Use the `database-query` tool when you only need to read from the database.

## Reading Browser Logs With the `browser-logs` Tool
- You can read browser logs, errors, and exceptions using the `browser-logs` tool from Boost.
- Only recent browser logs will be useful - ignore old logs.

## Searching Documentation (Critically Important)
- Boost comes with a powerful `search-docs` tool you should use before any other approaches when dealing with Laravel or Laravel ecosystem packages. This tool automatically passes a list of installed packages and their versions to the remote Boost API, so it returns only version-specific documentation for the user's circumstance. You should pass an array of packages to filter on if you know you need docs for particular packages.
- The `search-docs` tool is perfect for all Laravel-related packages, including Laravel, Inertia, Livewire, Filament, Tailwind, Pest, Nova, Nightwatch, etc.
- You must use this tool to search for Laravel ecosystem documentation before falling back to other approaches.
- Search the documentation before making code changes to ensure we are taking the correct approach.
- Use multiple, broad, simple, topic-based queries to start. For example: `['rate limiting', 'routing rate limiting', 'routing']`.
- Do not add package names to queries; package information is already shared. For example, use `test resource table`, not `filament 4 test resource table`.

### Available Search Syntax
- You can and should pass multiple queries at once. The most relevant results will be returned first.

1. Simple Word Searches with auto-stemming - query=authentication - finds 'authenticate' and 'auth'.
2. Multiple Words (AND Logic) - query=rate limit - finds knowledge containing both "rate" AND "limit".
3. Quoted Phrases (Exact Position) - query="infinite scroll" - words must be adjacent and in that order.
4. Mixed Queries - query=middleware "rate limit" - "middleware" AND exact phrase "rate limit".
5. Multiple Queries - queries=["authentication", "middleware"] - ANY of these terms.

=== php rules ===

## PHP

- Always use curly braces for control structures, even if it has one line.

### Constructors
- Use PHP 8 constructor property promotion in `__construct()`.
    - <code-snippet>public function __construct(public GitHub $github) { }</code-snippet>
- Do not allow empty `__construct()` methods with zero parameters unless the constructor is private.

### Type Declarations
- Always use explicit return type declarations for methods and functions.
- Use appropriate PHP type hints for method parameters.

<code-snippet name="Explicit Return Types and Method Params" lang="php">
protected function isAccessible(User $user, ?string $path = null): bool
{
    ...
}
</code-snippet>

## Comments
- Prefer PHPDoc blocks over inline comments. Never use comments within the code itself unless there is something very complex going on.

## PHPDoc Blocks
- Add useful array shape type definitions for arrays when appropriate.

## Enums
- Typically, keys in an Enum should be TitleCase. For example: `FavoritePerson`, `BestLake`, `Monthly`.

=== herd rules ===

## Laravel Herd

- The application is served by Laravel Herd and will be available at: `https?://[kebab-case-project-dir].test`. Use the `get-absolute-url` tool to generate URLs for the user to ensure valid URLs.
- You must not run any commands to make the site available via HTTP(S). It is always available through Laravel Herd.

=== tests rules ===

## Test Enforcement

- Every change must be programmatically tested. Write a new test or update an existing test, then run the affected tests to make sure they pass.
- Run the minimum number of tests needed to ensure code quality and speed. Use `php artisan test --compact` with a specific filename or filter.

=== laravel/core rules ===

## Do Things the Laravel Way

- Use `php artisan make:` commands to create new files (i.e. migrations, controllers, models, etc.). You can list available Artisan commands using the `list-artisan-commands` tool.
- If you're creating a generic PHP class, use `php artisan make:class`.
- Pass `--no-interaction` to all Artisan commands to ensure they work without user input. You should also pass the correct `--options` to ensure correct behavior.

### Database
- Always use proper Eloquent relationship methods with return type hints. Prefer relationship methods over raw queries or manual joins.
- Use Eloquent models and relationships before suggesting raw database queries.
- Avoid `DB::`; prefer `Model::query()`. Generate code that leverages Laravel's ORM capabilities rather than bypassing them.
- Generate code that prevents N+1 query problems by using eager loading.
- Use Laravel's query builder for very complex database operations.

### Model Creation
- When creating new models, create useful factories and seeders for them too. Ask the user if they need any other things, using `list-artisan-commands` to check the available options to `php artisan make:model`.

### APIs & Eloquent Resources
- For APIs, default to using Eloquent API Resources and API versioning unless existing API routes do not, then you should follow existing application convention.

### Controllers & Validation
- Always create Form Request classes for validation rather than inline validation in controllers. Include both validation rules and custom error messages.
- Check sibling Form Requests to see if the application uses array or string based validation rules.

### Queues
- Use queued jobs for time-consuming operations with the `ShouldQueue` interface.

### Authentication & Authorization
- Use Laravel's built-in authentication and authorization features (gates, policies, Sanctum, etc.).

### URL Generation
- When generating links to other pages, prefer named routes and the `route()` function.

### Configuration
- Use environment variables only in configuration files - never use the `env()` function directly outside of config files. Always use `config('app.name')`, not `env('APP_NAME')`.

### Testing
- When creating models for tests, use the factories for the models. Check if the factory has custom states that can be used before manually setting up the model.
- Faker: Use methods such as `$this->faker->word()` or `fake()->randomDigit()`. Follow existing conventions whether to use `$this->faker` or `fake()`.
- When creating tests, make use of `php artisan make:test [options] {name}` to create a feature test, and pass `--unit` to create a unit test. Most tests should be feature tests.

### Vite Error
- If you receive an "Illuminate\Foundation\ViteException: Unable to locate file in Vite manifest" error, you can run `npm run build` or ask the user to run `npm run dev` or `composer run dev`.

=== laravel/v12 rules ===

## Laravel 12

- Use the `search-docs` tool to get version-specific documentation.
- Since Laravel 11, Laravel has a new streamlined file structure which this project uses.

### Laravel 12 Structure
- In Laravel 12, middleware are no longer registered in `app/Http/Kernel.php`.
- Middleware are configured declaratively in `bootstrap/app.php` using `Application::configure()->withMiddleware()`.
- `bootstrap/app.php` is the file to register middleware, exceptions, and routing files.
- `bootstrap/providers.php` contains application specific service providers.
- The `app\Console\Kernel.php` file no longer exists; use `bootstrap/app.php` or `routes/console.php` for console configuration.
- Console commands in `app/Console/Commands/` are automatically available and do not require manual registration.

### Database
- When modifying a column, the migration must include all of the attributes that were previously defined on the column. Otherwise, they will be dropped and lost.
- Laravel 12 allows limiting eagerly loaded records natively, without external packages: `$query->latest()->limit(10);`.

### Models
- Casts can and likely should be set in a `casts()` method on a model rather than the `$casts` property. Follow existing conventions from other models.

=== livewire/core rules ===

## Livewire

- Use the `search-docs` tool to find exact version-specific documentation for how to write Livewire and Livewire tests.
- Use the `php artisan make:livewire [Posts\CreatePost]` Artisan command to create new components.
- State should live on the server, with the UI reflecting it.
- All Livewire requests hit the Laravel backend; they're like regular HTTP requests. Always validate form data and run authorization checks in Livewire actions.

## Livewire Best Practices
- Livewire components require a single root element.
- Use `wire:loading` and `wire:dirty` for delightful loading states.
- Add `wire:key` in loops:

    ```blade
    @foreach ($items as $item)
        <div wire:key="item-{{ $item->id }}">
            {{ $item->name }}
        </div>
    @endforeach
    ```

- Prefer lifecycle hooks like `mount()`, `updatedFoo()` for initialization and reactive side effects:

<code-snippet name="Lifecycle Hook Examples" lang="php">
    public function mount(User $user) { $this->user = $user; }
    public function updatedSearch() { $this->resetPage(); }
</code-snippet>

## Testing Livewire

<code-snippet name="Example Livewire Component Test" lang="php">
    Livewire::test(Counter::class)
        ->assertSet('count', 0)
        ->call('increment')
        ->assertSet('count', 1)
        ->assertSee(1)
        ->assertStatus(200);
</code-snippet>

<code-snippet name="Testing Livewire Component Exists on Page" lang="php">
    $this->get('/posts/create')
    ->assertSeeLivewire(CreatePost::class);
</code-snippet>

=== pint/core rules ===

## Laravel Pint Code Formatter

- You must run `vendor/bin/pint --dirty --format agent` before finalizing changes to ensure your code matches the project's expected style.
- Do not run `vendor/bin/pint --test --format agent`, simply run `vendor/bin/pint --format agent` to fix any formatting issues.

=== pest/core rules ===

## Pest
### Testing
- If you need to verify a feature is working, write or update a Unit / Feature test.

### Pest Tests
- All tests must be written using Pest. Use `php artisan make:test --pest {name}`.
- You must not remove any tests or test files from the tests directory without approval. These are not temporary or helper files - these are core to the application.
- Tests should test all of the happy paths, failure paths, and weird paths.
- Tests live in the `tests/Feature` and `tests/Unit` directories.
- Pest tests look and behave like this:
<code-snippet name="Basic Pest Test Example" lang="php">
it('is true', function () {
    expect(true)->toBeTrue();
});
</code-snippet>

### Running Tests
- Run the minimal number of tests using an appropriate filter before finalizing code edits.
- To run all tests: `php artisan test --compact`.
- To run all tests in a file: `php artisan test --compact tests/Feature/ExampleTest.php`.
- To filter on a particular test name: `php artisan test --compact --filter=testName` (recommended after making a change to a related file).
- When the tests relating to your changes are passing, ask the user if they would like to run the entire test suite to ensure everything is still passing.

### Pest Assertions
- When asserting status codes on a response, use the specific method like `assertForbidden` and `assertNotFound` instead of using `assertStatus(403)` or similar, e.g.:
<code-snippet name="Pest Example Asserting postJson Response" lang="php">
it('returns all', function () {
    $response = $this->postJson('/api/docs', []);

    $response->assertSuccessful();
});
</code-snippet>

### Mocking
- Mocking can be very helpful when appropriate.
- When mocking, you can use the `Pest\Laravel\mock` Pest function, but always import it via `use function Pest\Laravel\mock;` before using it. Alternatively, you can use `$this->mock()` if existing tests do.
- You can also create partial mocks using the same import or self method.

### Datasets
- Use datasets in Pest to simplify tests that have a lot of duplicated data. This is often the case when testing validation rules, so consider this solution when writing tests for validation rules.

<code-snippet name="Pest Dataset Example" lang="php">
it('has emails', function (string $email) {
    expect($email)->not->toBeEmpty();
})->with([
    'james' => 'james@laravel.com',
    'taylor' => 'taylor@laravel.com',
]);
</code-snippet>

=== pest/v4 rules ===

## Pest 4

- Pest 4 is a huge upgrade to Pest and offers: browser testing, smoke testing, visual regression testing, test sharding, and faster type coverage.
- Browser testing is incredibly powerful and useful for this project.
- Browser tests should live in `tests/Browser/`.
- Use the `search-docs` tool for detailed guidance on utilizing these features.

### Browser Testing
- You can use Laravel features like `Event::fake()`, `assertAuthenticated()`, and model factories within Pest 4 browser tests, as well as `RefreshDatabase` (when needed) to ensure a clean state for each test.
- Interact with the page (click, type, scroll, select, submit, drag-and-drop, touch gestures, etc.) when appropriate to complete the test.
- If requested, test on multiple browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari).
- If requested, test on different devices and viewports (like iPhone 14 Pro, tablets, or custom breakpoints).
- Switch color schemes (light/dark mode) when appropriate.
- Take screenshots or pause tests for debugging when appropriate.

### Example Tests

<code-snippet name="Pest Browser Test Example" lang="php">
it('may reset the password', function () {
    Notification::fake();

    $this->actingAs(User::factory()->create());

    $page = visit('/sign-in'); // Visit on a real browser...

    $page->assertSee('Sign In')
        ->assertNoJavascriptErrors() // or ->assertNoConsoleLogs()
        ->click('Forgot Password?')
        ->fill('email', 'nuno@laravel.com')
        ->click('Send Reset Link')
        ->assertSee('We have emailed your password reset link!')

    Notification::assertSent(ResetPassword::class);
});
</code-snippet>

<code-snippet name="Pest Smoke Testing Example" lang="php">
$pages = visit(['/', '/about', '/contact']);

$pages->assertNoJavascriptErrors()->assertNoConsoleLogs();
</code-snippet>
</laravel-boost-guidelines>
